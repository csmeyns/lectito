Carr et al., Symposium: The Time Difficulty in Realist Theories of Perception, carr1911aa,  15/05/23, 15/05/24 , Rich symposium; especially good for understanding conceptions of realism; Dawes Hicks has a bold proposal and makes 'stuff happens' observation
Descartes, 'Treatise on light', descartes1998aa,  15/05/23, 15/05/23 , Very original and witty; void; fluidity/solidity; imagines mechanistic universe; light extends in all directions instantaneously; but reflection (and refraction) takes time. 
Bosanquet, 'The Prediction of Human Conduct: A Study in Bergson', bosanquet1910aa,  15/05/23, 15/05/23 , Summarises Bergson's view of time from a practical perspective; shows how it comes close to but falls short of the best idealism (i.e. Bradley's)
Suchting, 'Perception and the Time-Gap Argument', suchting1969aa, 15/05/23, 15/05/23, Clear and specific presentation of argument; focuses on rejection of simultaneity; argument shows perceiverâ€™s belief in simultaneity is an error; similar to errors of refraction (bent stick); but different in that time of occurrence is not a quality while being bent is; reply to Meyers; discusses Smythies and Beloff; discusses alternative response to sense-datum conclusion that light is seen.
Meyers, 'Perception and the 'Time-Lag' argument', meyers1957aa,  15/05/23, 15/05/23 , Considers the argument an application of Zeno's reasoning to visual perception. Suggests there is no parallel with cases of television and reflection.
